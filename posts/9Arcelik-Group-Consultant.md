  Content Syndication: Developed a robust backend tool to export product information to local marketplaces, bolstering visibility.
  Where to Buy: Implemented a dynamic "Where to Buy" button on 45+ websites without an e-commerce store. This button displayed real-time prices and marketplace information on the Product Detail Page, guiding visitors to shop directly from marketplaces.
  These initiatives contributed to a 12% increase in global revenue.
