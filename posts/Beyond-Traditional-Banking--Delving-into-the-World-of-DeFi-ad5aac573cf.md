This article may lead to a series of posts about how blockchain is transforming finance, I hope you enjoy the first chapter.

DeFi is a new and exciting way to access financial services and products that are not controlled by traditional institutions. In other words, itâ€™s finance without the banks! Essentially, DeFi refers to a financial system that is built on blockchain technology and actually works without the need for intermediaries like banks, brokers, or exchanges. In this article, we will explore the fundamentals of DeFi and why it is becoming such an important milestone in the financial world.

**What is it**?

At its core, DeFi is about creating a financial system that is open, transparent, and accessible to everyone, regardless of their location or financial status. By leveraging blockchain technology, DeFi provides a way for financial transactions to be performed in a peer-to-peer way, avoiding the need for intermediaries or trusted third parties.

The core features of DeFi are decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. dApps are software programs running on blockchain technology, and smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. These technologies work together to enable DeFi apps to function autonomously with no need for intermediaries.

**Why is it important?**

DeFi is crucial for a number of reasons. By providing people more power over their own money, it has the ability to democratize finance in the first place. Financial institutions serve as gatekeepers and regulate the flow of money in traditional finance, which can limit access for many people. With DeFi, anyone with an internet connection can participate in the financial system, regardless of their location or financial status.

Second, compared to conventional finance, DeFi is more transparent. All transactions are recorded on a public ledger that anybody can audit because DeFi applications are built on blockchain technology. This level of transparency makes it more difficult for fraudulent or illegal activities to take place.

Third, DeFi is more efficient than traditional finance. Because it operates without intermediaries, transactions can be processed more rapidly and for a lower cost. This can lead to faster settlement times, lower fees, and eventually, a more efficient financial system.

**Examples of DeFi Applications**

DeFi apps come in a variety of forms, each with special features and advantages. Some of the most popular DeFi applications include:

*   Decentralized exchanges (DEXs): DEXs are platforms that allow users to trade cryptocurrencies without the need for intermediaries. They use smart contracts to execute trades and manage orders. The most known platforms are Uniswap, Curve Finance, PancakeSwap, and Sushiswap.
*   Decentralized lending and borrowing platforms: These platforms allow users to lend or borrow cryptocurrency without the need for a traditional financial institution. They use smart contracts to manage loans and interest rates. The most known platforms are Aave, MakerDAO, Compound Finance, and JustLend.
*   Stablecoins: Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to a stable asset like the US dollar. They are used to provide stability and reduce volatility in the cryptocurrency markets. The most known stablecoins are USDT, USDC, BUSD, DAI, TUSD, and FRAX.
*   Decentralized asset management platforms: These platforms allow users to invest in a range of assets, including cryptocurrencies, stocks, and commodities, using smart contracts. The most known platforms are Zapper, DefiSaver, and Zerion.

Decentralized finance is a rapidly growing sector of the financial industry that is changing the way we think about money and finance. By leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts, DeFi is making finance more open, transparent, and accessible to everyone. As more people become aware of the potential benefits of DeFi, we can expect to see continued growth and innovation in this exciting new sector.
