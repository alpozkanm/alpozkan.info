title: "ArÃ§elik Group - Software Engineer"
description: >-
  I played a critical role in creating a new revenue channel through the 360 omnichannel program, enhancing the visual customer experience through the Videowall project. Overcoming integration challenges with giant plasma screens, touch sensors, and real-size product displays, I achieved success by implementing the project for > 200 local stores and dealers in Turkey.
  I led a task force that optimized user engagement, conversions, and SEO scores. Our team efforts reduced page load time from 14.9 seconds to 4 seconds for 75 digital products, attracting over 10 million visitors.
