Hey friends, first time posting here, and super excited…

We were all worried, right? but not for ourselves, but for friends who used the privacy protocol before..

Web3 is an open and permissionless protocol where users can interact with each other without giving up ownership control, privacy, or relying on intermediaries.

​​Crypto mixing service Tornado Cash was blacklisted by the Treasury Department of United States for alleged use in laundering.

**What happened?**

> All transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or otherwise blocked persons are prohibited unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt,” the Treasury Department said.

Biggest topic of concern is privacy for everyone using blockchain smart contracts. Another concern is using the TC with good intentions like donating money to Ukraine. The people who used the privacy protocol, and transferred funds from CEX wallets such as Binance or Coinbase as points of origin for their DeFi wallets were concerned about their anonymity. There is no such thing as making an entrance to a decentralized finance ecosystem without transferring funds from centralized and governed banking or exchange solutions.

More than 50 people gathered in Amsterdam’s Dam Square on Saturday to protest the arrest of blockchain developer Alexey Pertsev, who was arrested on August 10 on suspicion of involvement in the Tornado Cash protocol that was sanctioned earlier this month by U.S. authorities.

So what is actually happening on the relevant part of the DeFi privacy protocol? It’s known as a privacy protocol that uses a cryptocurrency mixer that is most active on Ethereum blockchain and facilitates anonymous transactions by making it extremely difficult to trace crypto wallets involved with these transactions.

- Depositors connect their decentralized wallet to a specific chain they wish to use,
- choose the specific amount of ETH or other cryptocurrencies,
- make a deposit to the mixer,
- receive a note regarding the deposit.

It’s crucial to select a specific amount and wait for 2 days after the deposit to be unknown, this is recommended by the protocol and the people who use it. With this note, the other party who wishes to withdraw the money enters this note and crypto wallet address, and after that they receive the amount of cryptocurrency without being spotted(some can investigate further and link specific accounts and find the related parties if there are multiple transactions).

Some details from the hacks and laundered funds:

> The laundered funds include $445 million stolen by the Lazarus Group, a notorious North Korean-backed hacking group that is already under U.S. sanctions. The U.S. previously linked Lazarus to the theft of $625 million in cryptocurrency from the Ronin Network, an Ethereum-based sidechain made for the popular play-to-earn game Axie Infinity, and more recently the $100 million theft from Harmony’s Horizon bridge. North Korea has long used cryptocurrency-stealing operations, like ransomware, to fund its nuclear weapons program.

It’s a niche topic. Protocols can be used to launder money with unknown parties. There are lots of motives involved with the privacy protocols, people can use it to transfer money to their other crypto wallets without being tracked or even taxed.

There have been several hacks with stolen money from DeFi protocols transferred using this protocol. It has been analyzed and presented that %28 of the transfers have been used by hackers and people with bad intentions.

- Tornado Cash on the day after the sanctions, processed over $2 million worth of cryptocurrency transactions.
- Circle, who is known for issuing USDC, frozen the accounts that are related with this privacy protocol.
- Github suspended the pages that are used for development purposes for the related protocol.
- Some DeFi apps started to block the accounts that have been used to make transactions using the privacy protocol.
- According to a member of the privacy protocol team, the decentralized voting system that has been used to vote on the topics related with the protocol and make decisions by governance known as DAO and decided to shut down by their own governance members.

**What about wallets added to the blacklist on dApps (Decentralized Finance Apps)?**

> Aave, Uniswap, DyDx, and Balancer, who are known to be decentralized finance apps, started to block the accounts that have been used to make transactions using the privacy protocol.

If your wallet is blocked on these mentioned protocols, it means you have used Tornado Cash before and these protocols added you to blacklist permanently. These protocols published some announcements regarding the situation, you can explain the activities and send an email to request a compliance check for unblocking your account by explaining your intentions.

**What happened recently :**

On October 2nd, 2022, Transit Finance lost $21 million after a vulnerability in their code-base allowed a hacker to drain the wallets of users who had approved the protocol’s swap contract. The hacker exploited an internal bug on a swap contract within the protocol and caused other individuals to imitate the security breach, leading to a loss of over $21 million in user funds.

The hacker has returned over 83% of the stolen assets thanks to the help of multiple security companies such as Peckshield.

They quickly tracked down the hacker by identifying their IP address, email address, and associated-on chain addresses.

The hacker also transferred 2,500 BNB tokens ($686,000) to sanctioned privacy protocol Tornado Cash as a bounty for this event, on-chain data shows.

Hope you enjoyed reading the first post, clap if you liked and please make a comment to encourage me for future posts 😜.
